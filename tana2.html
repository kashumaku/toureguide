<h1> About Lake Tana</h1>

<p>Rivaling the attraction of the Blue Nile Falls are the thirty-seven islands <br>
The Blue Nile runs from Lake Tana's southeast corner, flowing south over a lava dam to<br> 
form the Tisisat Falls - the name in Ethiopian means 'the water that smokes' - then flowing <br>
northwest to merge with the White Nile and form the full-fledged Nile itself. <br>
The Blue Nile contributes two thirds of all the Nile discharge, along with most of the <br>
sediment carried along 4750 kilometres through to Egypt and the Mediterranean.<br>
